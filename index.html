          <h4>A public domain</h4>
          <p>
            When you publish your Wunderbucket site it goes directly to your domain.
            You can add a custom domain any time you want by flipping your site from “Dev” to “Live”.

      <h2>100% static, clean output</h2>
      <p>
        When you upload your site to Wunderbucket, we run Merge on the server to generate 100% static output so there's
        no loading delay like you might see on your localhost site. We also remove every trace of Merge, so your
        source code stays clean and pretty.
      </p>
      <p>Just try making a change and publishing this site. View the source code on your public domain once it's done to
        see what we're talking about.</p>

    You might notice that this HTML isn't minimized and it doesn't have lots of
    libraries embedded in it. We think that this is how HTML should look
    for most websites. We hope you use Wunderbucket to build pages that will last.
